 I'm Yunus Emre 👋
I'm a junior full-stack developer focused mainly on JavaScript.  
I’m  still early in my journey, but I learn fast, build consistently, and improve every single week.

## What I Work On
- Full-stack web apps with **Node.js** & **React**
- APIs, backend logic, and simple, clean UIs
- Small projects to strengthen fundamentals
- Realistic, practical solutions — not just tutorial code

## Tech Stack
**Languages:** JavaScript (main), TypeScript (in progress)  
**Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express  
**Database:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL (basic), Firebase  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub, Linux, VS Code

## What I'm Focusing On Now
- Getting better at backend architecture (Node.js + Express)
- Building portfolio-level projects that solve real problems  
- Improving TypeScript and SQL  
- Preparing for freelance/remote opportunities

## A Bit About Me
I like keeping things simple: build, break, fix, improve.  
I’m curious, consistent, and not afraid to learn anything that helps me level up as a developer.
